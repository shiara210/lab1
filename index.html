<p><br>Hi! I'm <b><i>Shiaramae Faburada</b></i>, But you can call me <b><i>Mae</b></i> as my nickname,</br> 
<br>i'm a <i>shy type person but I'm friendly</i>,I live in Taguig city,</br>
<br>so the things that I really like to do are Singing and Drawing</br>
<br>because in these kind of arts I can express what I feel.</br>

<br>the best journey I've ever experienced is traveling at night</br>
<br>because it is different during the daylight and i was so happy that time becasue</br>
<br>I got my money from my Scholarship and I spend half of it and</br>
<br>my parent  allowed me to spend some of my money and go home late but,</br> 
<br>the only thing they didn't allowed is to travel far away places, like batanes and vigan.</br>
<br>Even though i have limitation I'm still happy for all those moment</br>
<br>when I'm going outside with my family and friends.</br>
<br>
<br>In my expectation in this subject since I already experience to used basic html,</br>
I expect to learn more to enhance my skill to design user interface</p></br></br>
